The Dark Patterns Repository catalogues deceptive design techniques, aiding users in recognizing manipulative practices. With categorized patterns and examples, it fosters awareness and supports research to combat unethical design, essential for understanding and addressing interface manipulation in digital contexts.

Abstract: 
Dark patterns are tricky design tricks on websites and apps that push people into actions they 
don't intend, like buying or sharing personal info. Solving dark patterns matters because they confuse 
users, break trust, and make online experiences annoying. By addressing these tactics, we create fair, 
clear digital spaces that respect users' choices, making the internet more trustworthy and pleasant 
for all. 
Dark patterns, insidious design techniques woven into digital interfaces, persist as a 
formidable challenge to ethical user experiences. This investigation delves into the realm of 
prevalent dark patterns, encompassing practices such as social proofing,  disguised ads, nagging, 
confirm shaming, fake urgency, false scarcity, and phantom pricing.  
The "fake urgency" extension contributes to an enriched browsing experience by managing 
tab activation states and identifying timers or analogous time-sensitive elements on web pages. 
Employing content scripts, it adeptly highlights timers, assisting users in navigating time-sensitive 
tasks. Our “ad extension”, a vigilant browser tool, tracks and highlights ads on web pages with a 
distinctive red border, functioning as a warning to users, cautioning against clicking on these 
potentially misleading advertisements. Upon user interaction, the extension counts and highlights 
ads, offering users control over the ads encountered during their browsing journey. 
“Nagging Detector”, a Chrome extension, employs smart algorithms to enhance your 
browsing experience by identifying potentially intrusive pop-ups on websites. It evaluates the 
frequency, types, and size of pop-ups, intelligently determining if they could disrupt your navigation. 
If the threshold is surpassed, it notifies you, allowing for a more informed and interruption-free 
online experience. Additionally, our “ Volume extension”, tailored for blind users, integrates 
machine learning to identify dark patterns within website content. This tool provides visual 
highlights for sighted users and spoken alerts via a text-to-speech engine for blind users, significantly 
enhancing accessibility and promoting a safer online experience. Lastly, our extension uses machine 
learning to discern "confirm shaming" language patterns, diligently examining webpage text to 
promptly alert users upon detecting such language patterns. Trained on a comprehensive dataset, 
this feature offers informed awareness and control during the browsing experience.
